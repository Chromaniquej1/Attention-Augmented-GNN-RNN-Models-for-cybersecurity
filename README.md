## 1. Project Title
**Enhancing Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection Using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Attention Layers on the UNSW-NB15 Dataset**

## 2. Introduction
In today's digital landscape, network intrusion detection is crucial for maintaining the integrity of IT infrastructures. Traditional machine learning methods have been extensively used for intrusion detection, but they often fail to leverage the relationships between entities in network traffic data.

This proposal introduces a novel method that enhances network intrusion detection by combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and attention mechanisms to detect threats effectively.

## 3. Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to improve network intrusion detection using advanced deep learning techniques. Specific objectives include:

1. Develop a hybrid GNN-RNN model with attention mechanisms for the UNSW-NB15 dataset.
2. Compare model performance with traditional ML algorithms (Random Forest, SVM) and existing deep learning methods (CNN, RNN).
3. Ensure the novelty of the model by conducting a comprehensive literature review.
4. Optimize the model by experimenting with different GNN layers (e.g., GCN, GAT) and attention mechanisms.
5. Visualize graph structures and attention weights for model interpretability.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Data Preprocessing
- **Dataset**: The UNSW-NB15 dataset includes various network traffic features and will be preprocessed by selecting key features and scaling them.
- **Graph Construction**: A graph structure will be created where nodes represent entities (e.g., IP addresses) and edges represent communications between entities.
- **Labeling**: Two-class labels will be used: normal and attack.

### 4.2 Model Architecture
- **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**: The GNN will capture relationships between nodes, aggregating information using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) or Graph Attention Networks (GAT).
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: The RNN (LSTM) will capture sequential dependencies in network events over time.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Attention layers will help the model focus on important nodes and time steps.
- **Training**: The model will be trained using cross-entropy loss, and the Adam optimizer will be used for parameter updates.

### 4.3 Model Evaluation
- **Training**: An 80/20 train-test split will be used.
- **Metrics**: The model will be evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
- **Comparison**: The GNN-RNN-attention model will be compared to traditional models like Random Forest and Logistic Regression.

### 4.4 Visualization
- **Graph Visualization**: Visualizing the input graph structure, showing how the GNN aggregates node features.
- **Attention Visualization**: Visualizing attention weights to understand model focus areas in decision-making.
